            <p>Hi I'm James!</p>

        <p>For a few years now, I've actually been writing about the various sporting events that I go to, as that's one of my hobbies. Now, I figured I'd share those writings with the internet.</p>

        <p>As a software developer, I figured the best way for me to do that would be to build my own site as opposed to using WordPress or Medium. The basic layout of this blog is copied from the one I made for my personal blog (which I'll link to when I actually get around to updating it again).</p>

        <p>I hope you'll enjoy my journeys.</p>
