*\*This trip occurred on July 6, 2025, and I have so many thoughts on what happened that I’ve had to structure this post a bit differently than my other posts.*

### PART 1: The teams

If you've been following baseball as a sport, you probably know at least a little bit about the Savannah Bananas. For those who don't, here's a short-ish history:

Savannah, GA, was home to various minor league baseball teams throughout the 20th century and early 2000s. The most recent one - the Savannah Sand Gnats (who I used to have a shirt for) - left town in 2015 (they’re now the Columbia Fireflies of Columbia, SC). The following year, a bold entrepreneur founded the Savannah Bananas, filling the void left by the Sand Gnats.

Originally a member of the summer collegiate Coastal Plain League, they became famous for their on the field antics during games - things like a dance troupe composed of older women, a player on stilts, and a guy who did his own PA intro. These antics turned the team into media darlings; home games were consistently sold out, and they were even (seemingly) pulling in fans on the road; I thought about going to a game in Wilmington, NC one year while on vacation, but it was sold out when I looked into getting tickets (and it also rained that day, which made things iffy).

Outside of their CPL team, the most notable thing they did was in 2018, when they debuted a new set of rules for their version of baseball which came to be known as “Banana Ball". As part of this, a second "house team" - the (Savannah) Party Animals - was added to serve as a "foil" to the Bananas (though they were nowhere near as bad as the Washington Generals). The Bananas and Party Animals played their first game of Banana Ball in 2020, and a year later, they played their first game outside of Savannah in Mobile, AL.

In 2022, after winning the Coastal Plain League for the second year in a row and the third time overall, they decided to leave the league and go full Harlem Globetrotters - focusing solely on Banana Ball. They embarked on their first “Banana Ball World Tour” in 2023 - consistently selling out stadiums and drawing massive media attention. In 2024, they added Major League Baseball stadiums into the mix, as well as a new team: the Firefighters, who were the other team I saw at this game (plus they booked a damn CRUISE SHIP vacation for the entire org + fans). In 2025, they added the Texas Tailgaters, and two more teams are being added in 2026, which will also see an organized “Banana Ball Championship League” start up with each team playing 60 games (which translates to a whopping 180 total Banana Ball games next year).

### PART 2: …So what the heck is Banana Ball?

Banana Ball is, in essence, a modified version of baseball. The team lists eleven rules that make it distinct[^1] (these are taken directly from the Banana Ball website):

*__RULE 1: WIN THE INNING, GET THE POINT__<br>
Every inning is worth one point. The team that gets the most runs in an inning, gets a point for that inning, except for the last inning, where every run counts.*

*__RULE 2: TWO HOUR TIME LIMIT__<br>
You get the idea. No new inning can be started after 2 hours. In the last inning of the game, every run counts.*

*__RULE 3: NO STEPPING OUT__<br>
If the hitter steps out of the box, it’s a strike.*

*__RULE 4: NO. BUNTING.__<br>
Bunting sucks. If a hitter bunts, they are ejected from the game.*

*__RULE 5: BATTERS CAN STEAL FIRST__<br>
On any pitch of an at-bat, the hitter can try to steal first base. This can happen on a pass ball or wild pitch.*

*__RULE 6: NO WALKS ALLOWED__<br>
If a pitcher throws ball four, it becomes a sprint. The hitter will take off running while every defensive player on the field must touch the ball before it becomes live. The hitter can advance to as many bases as they want. The ball does not have to touch the catcher or pitcher.*

*__RULE 7: NO MOUND VISITS ALLOWED__<br>
Let’s keep the game moving. No mound visits from the coach, catcher, or any other player at any time. Hype your pitcher up from afar if needed.*

*__RULE 8: IF A FAN CATCHES A FOUL BALL, IT'S AN OUT__<br>
Why not let the fans get in on some of the action? Whatever you do, just don’t catch a foul ball.*

*__RULE 9: SHOWDOWN TIE BREAKER__<br>
If the game is tied at the end of the two-hour time limit, the game will go into a Showdown Tiebreaker. In each Showdown, the hitter must score. If they score, it’s worth one point. If they get out, it’s worth no points and it’s called a Showdown Shutdown.*

- *ROUND 1: Pitcher, catcher, and one fielder vs one hitter.*
- *ROUND 2: Pitcher and catcher vs one hitter.*
- *ROUND 3: Pitcher, catcher, and one fielder vs one hitter with bases loaded.*

*In this Final Showdown, every run counts as a point. If no team has won after three Showdowns, they will continue with the bases loaded and one fielder until one team has won.*

*If at any point a homerun is hit over the outfield wall, it’s a walkoff win and the game is over.*

*__RULE 10: THE BANANA BALL CHALLENGE RULE__<br>
In Banana Ball, each team is allowed to challenge one ruling on the field. The coach of each team will have a challenge prop/item that they must throw/shoot on the field before the next pitch for the play to be challenged.*

*The play will be reviewed by the broadcast and the call will be replayed to the Umpire Field Chief to make the call. If a team wins the challenge and the call is overruled, the team will retain a challenge for later in the game. If the call is upheld or the challenge is inconclusive, they will lose their opportunity to challenge for the rest of the game.*

*THREE CATEGORIES OF CHALLENGES:*
- *Fair/foul ball calls*
- *Force/tag play calls*
- *Catch plays in the outfield or infield*

*THE FAN CHALLENGE RULE:
In addition to each team’s challenge, the fans will have one opportunity to challenge a ruling during the game.*

*Prior to the game, the fans will choose one fan to represent them. The fan representative will have the opportunity to challenge one play a night. If the fan representative chooses to challenge, the fan will shoot off confetti and hold up the “Fan Challenge” sign to make it official.*

*__RULE 11: THE GOLDEN BATTER RULE__<br>
One time a game, a team may send any hitter in the lineup to bat in any spot.*

*Goal of the rule: Your best hitter can hit when the game is on the line.*

*Examples:  
Ex 1.) Due up in the lineup are hitters 6,7, & 8. 6 & 7 make the first two outs. The team then uses the Golden Batter Rule to hit their #3 hitter in the 8-hole.  The #3 hitter reaches base. The 8-hole would stay in the game but he would not hit. The next hitter is the 9-hole. If the #3 hitter was on base and his spot in the lineup came to bat then the #8 hitter would become the pinch runner. Also if eligible the Designated Pinch Runner could run.  
Ex 2.)  The Golden Batter could technically hit back-to-back in one inning if the team chose to do so.*

There’s also a few rule differences between Banana Ball and regular baseball that are not part of the official Banana Ball rules:

Each team has TEN batters in their lineup (as opposed to the standard nine). This rule - referred to as the “Extra Hitter” - is rather rare amongst professional baseball competitions; it’s more common below high school varsity level (and don’t get me started on Little League).
Each team also has a “Designated Runner” (alluded to in the Golden Batter rule) - I.e. a guy whose main job is to just be a pinch runner, but can be used multiple times per game (as opposed to being a full substitution like in baseball).

I’ll give my full thoughts on these rules later, but in short: this is basically “lightning baseball”, and could honestly stand on its own as a fun-to-watch baseball variant (even without the on-field antics).

### PART 3: A Whole Lotto Tickets

Demand for tickets has been high since the team’s inception, and despite the expansion of the brand into four (and soon to be six) teams, said demand has not cooled one bit. For example, I saw something online that said that over 182,000 people entered the ticket lottery for just over 80,000 tickets at Chicago’s Rate Field (insert your own White Sox joke here). However, given that the 182,000 entrants likely represents far more people than that (i.e. friends and families), and that the 80,000 tickets is likely lower due to presales (more on that in a sec), it’s more likely that almost a million people are competing for 40-50,000 seats. I will note here that one of the main reasons this post got so long is because of the heavily involved process of getting Banana Ball tickets - but I’m also getting a bit ahead of myself here…

While the method the Bananas have used to distribute tickets has changed a bit over the years, getting Banana Ball tickets, like it or not, is almost purely luck based. In addition, the Bananas are VERY anti-scalper (to the point where they developed their own ticketing platform), so there are a TON of measures they use to try and prevent ticket scalping (such as only sending tickets three days before events, requiring verification, etc.). Sadly, I have heard stories about the Bananas losing fans simply due to the fact that people get unlucky year after year thanks to how random getting tickets (seemingly) is and/or issues involving the secondary market.

To explain the lottery process, I’ll use the dates from their current tour (2025)[^2]. Some of this information is from secondhand sources (for reasons you’ll see soon), so bear with me if I get something wrong.

On October 4, 2024, the Bananas announced their dates for the 2025 Banana Ball World Tour. Immediately after the dates were announced, fans were invited to join a lottery list for tickets; signups for this list closed on November 1, 2024. There is something else called the “ticket interest” list (which is the list to sign up for after the ticket lottery closes), but it’s stated upfront that you won’t be able to get tickets for 2025.

Around two months before each individual game, every fan in the lottery finds out whether or not they’re going to be able to (have the chance to) purchase tickets. If you get drawn to get tickets, you are then asked to verify your account on their ticketing platform (as mentioned earlier, they made their own ticket platform to combat fees/scalpers), and then you are eventually given a date and specific time slot when you can get tickets - or the bad news that you will (almost certainly) not have a chance to get tickets (i.e. if you have a later time slot and/or are placed on “standby”).

I have heard that having season tickets for the team that normally plays at the stadium you want to go to can help you get in via a presale opportunity, but I have no clue if this is true (though I also heard that this practice is limited to MLB venues only). I do know that the Brockton Rox - who I had visited the day before my game - used this tactic to try and sell season tickets in 2023 (during their tumultuous Futures League days) when their stadium hosted a Banana Ball game (no clue how that went).

If you’re not a fan of having your opportunity to see Banana Ball be fully up to chance nor can stomach paying for season tickets, there is another way to bypass this lottery system (sorta): the K Club.

### PART 4: Going (K) Clubbin’

The K Club is the Bananas’ “superfan” group, which comes with a lot of perks, but the biggest perk is very easily the ability to buy tickets before the general public (i.e. the lotteries). However, the thing about the K Club is that it’s NOT easy to get into (apparently).

On the surface, the process seems decently simplistic. There’s a page on the Bananas’ website where you can join their “K Club Interest List”, and through most of the year, the Bananas accept signups for this list.

#### UPDATE THIS WHEN 2026 K CLUB STUFF IS KNOWN[^3]

<!-- At some point in September (I think), sign ups close - as indicated by this message:

*The K Club Interest List is now CLOSED for the 2025 season.*

*Invitations have been sent to those on the 2025 interest list with information on how to join, check your email for info!*

*Check back in October to join the 2026 Interest List.* -->

Said invitation is a request from the team for you to verify some of your account details on their ticketing website. Once you do that, you are then given a window during which you have to pay a membership fee (all of this being similar to buying regular tickets), and then once you do that, you’re in! Once you’re in the K Club, you don’t need to join the interest list for the following years; the only thing you need to do is pay the membership fee each year. You are also allowed to leave the K Club if you sense you won’t be buying Banana Ball tickets, but I’m not sure what that process is; I did find a page for a “Do Not Renew” form, but there was no form when I checked it (there’s also the fact that I don’t expect too many people not renewing for…reasons).

There is one catch to ALL of this, however: in order to be able to purchase K Club membership…you have to win a (secret) lottery. Note that this K Club lottery is NOT disclosed on their website (and seemingly isn’t even insinuated either), so be forewarned that signing up for the interest list does NOT guarantee you K Club access. I have heard that you only need to sign up once for the interest list, and then you’re in the K Club lottery each year until you win/get in, but have no idea how true this is (and trying to test it is going to take a literal year, so…).

Word on the street is that demand to get into the K Club is getting REAL high (which makes sense given its status as a ticket presale). The official K Club group on Facebook has just over 21,000 members and you NEED to be a verified K Club member to have access, so given that the K Club has only been around since 2023, that means that they’ve been adding ~7,000 members a year (and likely getting WAY more requests than that). In my opinion, getting in will probably become harder and harder each coming year as more people realize it’s the best way to get the best seats (especially at venues where that is extremely important). It’s also unlikely that many people will (willingly) leave the K Club in the near future unless one or more of the following happens:

- The price of membership gets exorbitant[^4]
They eliminate the presale aspect (which would TANK signups/memberships)
Interest in Banana Ball wanes

A lot of the information comes from various sources on the internet (much like the ticket lottery), but if you were wondering how I know so much about how to get into the K Club, that’s because…

…I signed up for the 2025 interest list and GOT IN ON MY FIRST TRY. Thus, I never had to sign up for any ticket lotteries to get into any games (for 2025); in fact, Reddit posts about not getting K Club access are how I learned that it was a lottery in the first place! My memories of the process are kinda fuzzy and I don’t remember if there were any indications of any lotteries in the messages I received as I’ve deleted the emails (I don’t like having a bunch of old emails in my inbox), but for now, I am treating this thing just like Green Bay Packers season tickets (‘cause that’s pretty much what this is)[^5].

### PART 5: In Da K Club

So now that you know what the K Club is and that I’m part of it, I’d like to discuss life in the K Club[^6].

First, let’s talk about the people in the K Club. Members are separated into “classes” based on the year they joined; as of me writing this, there are classes of 2023, 2024, and 2025 (which I’m a member of), and they’re currently (July 2025) accepting signups for the Class of 2026 Interest List (again, good luck if you’re thinking about it). As mentioned earlier, there’s a Facebook group which is restricted to K Club members only; I’m not actually sure if I’m in it or not, though I’m also not active on Facebook (so in essence I’m saying it’s possible that there are more than 21,000 K Club members).

Besides the most obvious perk of an exclusive window to buy (nearly) guaranteed tickets, other perks include access to exclusive merch (which I haven’t gone for - yet), fun insider knowledge (such as being the first to know about a surprise game the Bananas played against Clemson in November 2024), and some perks when you’re at a Banana Ball game itself, but I’ll get to those later (they vary from stadium to stadium, so I’ll focus on the ones I got) - just know that you receive a badge in the mail that you’re SUPPOSED to bring to the game.

As for how getting tickets works, it’s similar to the regular system: you are given a specific window during which you can buy tickets, but unlike the regular system, you can buy tickets for ANY GAME OF THE YEAR - not just a specific selected city. Your window for buying tickets is based on what year you joined; this is important for two reasons:

1. The K Club is more or less the only way to get into Grayson Stadium in Savannah (Banana Ball’s traditional home); however, I don’t recall being offered any of these games when I went to buy tickets (though I do recall getting an email at some point indicating I could get Grayson Stadium tickets).
2. There are a limited number of “Very Important Banana” tickets for each event, and they sell FAST. For the game I went to, the VIB tickets for the game I went to had already sold out for the ENTIRE GAME before I had a chance to get tickets (i.e. there were no VIB tickets for the general lottery). Thus, I can’t tell you what the VIB ticket gets you, though indications are it’s just meet and greets which I’m not sure I’m interested in (though that also includes field access).

You only have this one opportunity to buy your special K Club tickets for the WHOLE YEAR, and you’re only allowed six tickets per game, so you do need to bear that in mind (i.e. if you plan on bringing people). This all happens BEFORE the regular ticket lotteries start, so if you really want to see the Bananas, it’s a good way of scheduling parts of your entire year (especially if you can snag Savannah tickets). Also, much like Las Vegas, K Club tickets stay in K Club as they can’t be transferred to non-K Club members (even your own friends and family if you can’t make it for whatever reason as the K Club member HAS to be in attendance at the game). These measures were, from what I can tell, added in 2025 as the previous years seemingly had enough people using the K Club to, well…y’know (though apparently that doesn’t stop people from trying!). I have heard that if the Bananas find out that you’ve done this, you will get expelled from the K Club, so be VERY CAREFUL about reselling tickets should a need to come up.

For me, I was allowed to buy my ticket in the last group (as the Class of 2025 was the most recent one at the time) about a week or so before Thanksgiving 2024. Inasmuch as I would have liked to go to multiple events, situations made me decide to hone in on one specific stop: Fenway Park.

### PART 6: Boston you’re my home (or We Don’t Talk About the Dropkick Murphys Anymore)[^7]

Fenway Park is famously the oldest park in Major League Baseball, having been opened in 1912. Nestled a mile or so from downtown Boston in the Fenway-Kenmore section, so many famous players and so many famous moments have occurred in the park’s over 100 year history.

As someone who used to frequent the area, I must say...I don’t feel like it’s THAT special. Yes, you can "feel the history" when you're inside, but the "history" hides a lot of things that have very much evolved which simply can't be changed with Fenway. The main concourse lacks field views, the upper deck is still held up by poles obstructing some seats, and there are still a lot of super old wooden seats in the grandstand (which I’ve heard are rather uncomfortable). However, I feel like I should also note that Fenway is a bit of a “mishmash” of things that were built in very different decades - you have:

- The original seating bowl which runs from foul pole to foul pole, though parts of it have been rebuilt due to fires
- A second deck above the grandstand, which has seats, suites, and the press box (1946)
- The green outfield seats plus the famous “lone red seat” marking the longest home run hit within the park (1934 - after they burned down in a fire)
- (Formerly) Glass enclosed seats behind home plate - above the main bowl but below the press area (1988)
- A club area above the roof of the upper deck in right field (2004)
- The Green Monster (1933 - after a fire) and the seats above it (2003)
- Massive video boards (2011)
- Rooftop farms (not sure, but it’s definitely from the 2010s)

In addition, parking in the area is either incredibly difficult to find and/or WAY TOO EXPENSIVE (which I learned the hard way), so the T is typically the recommended way to get to/from Fenway - when it works (you can find MUCH CHEAPER parking near several T stations, and some stops even have abundant free parking on Sundays). I had a morning commitment in the Downtown Crossing neighborhood (i.e. downtown Boston), so I ended up parking there (I THOUGHT about trying to park on a local street, but opted against it for several reasons). Just be forewarned, however: speaking from experience (and not even a Red Sox game), expect postgame trains to be FRIGHTENINGLY packed.

Apparently, the Bananas’ Fenway Park stop in 2024 was one of the most sought after tickets last year, as it was apparently the second biggest of the Bananas’ ticket lotteries (behind only Houston - Banana Ball’s first ever MLB stadium). A large part of that can be attributed to the fact that Banana Ball creator Jesse Cole is originally from Scituate, MA (a town in the South Shore area of Greater Boston) and was formerly an honorary Red Sox bat boy, so this was expected to be a particularly special show.

Like many, I was one of the people who signed up for the ticket lottery for Fenway…sadly, I didn’t get lucky despite signing up within an hour of them announcing their 2024 Fenway date. It’s largely because of this “miss” and another one the year prior (in Brockton, MA) that I decided to try joining the K Club (which, as I mentioned, I got into without realizing it was a lottery). While the Bananas did have two games at Fenway this year, for whatever reason (I honestly couldn’t tell you why), I opted for just the second game.

K Club membership cost me $59, and the ticket itself was $60, so I paid $119 in total - a bit pricey, but I ended up sitting in the back row of one of the loge boxes on the first base side (which costs at least 2-3 times what I paid for a marquee Red Sox game). This was important not only because it provided a good view of the action, but more importantly: SHADE. Unfortunately, it was still quite hot though…

Speaking of the K Club, I’ve mentioned that there’s other perks to joining the K Club for the event itself, but I haven’t even begun to discuss THAT aspect, so without further ado…

### PART 7: SHOWTAIMU

The game day experience started at 11 AM - FOUR AND A HALF HOURS before the game was scheduled to start at 3:30. The streets around Fenway Park were closed off to traffic, and fans got to walk around the streets near the stadium (this also happens during Sox games). Players for both teams also wandered around the area, signing autographs and taking photos with fans. However, the most unfortunately unfortunate thing was a pre-show on one of the streets: meant to hype up the fans, it ended up causing a MASSIVE traffic jam which I needed to walk through. Part of that may be the fact that said pre-show is not streamed, so people who had seen games online but had never been probably wanted to check it out.

At 1:00, MOST fans were let into the stadium itself. The exception: if you had a K Club and/or VIB ticket, you got to use a special entrance to the event/stadium and access to an exclusive area when the gates opened. In this case, we were allowed into (part of) the main concourse of the stadium at the same time the gates opened (but the seats weren’t opened until a little before everyone else was let in), which gave us the opportunity to access at least some of the concession stands early (something that ended up being SUPER important as they were intensely busy the whole day). Yes, you end up missing out on a lot of the pregame festivities if you just go to the K Club area and stay there, but it is MUCH less crowded (and, more importantly on a day with a Heat Advisory, shaded). As I mentioned earlier, you’re SUPPOSED to bring your badge to the game to get access, but I forgot to bring mine. However, my ticket on my account on the Bananas’ ticket website (but not in Apple Wallet) was marked as a K Club ticket, so I was able to show that to security and they let me in (though I did end up having to walk through the massive crowd at the pre-show as I mentioned earlier). 

Some time after fans start taking their seats, a pregame show occurs featuring a few of the players and a cavalcade of characters the organization has introduced over the years, such as the “Man-nana’s Dad Bod Cheerleading Squad” (not sure if endearing or offensive), “The Young Professor”, and “Princess Potassia”. During this pregame, the two teams are introduced and do a bunch of crazy antics as they’re being introduced. Then…the real fun begins.

There’s loud music blaring, various players and characters dancing and singing, the fans dancing and singing, a Lion King reference, a Suite Life of Zack and Cody reference (fitting since that show was set in Boston), track one from the Kangaroo Jack soundtrack (don’t ask how I know that), various events going on involving fans, and other things I don’t completely remember because there was just so much going on!

Oh, right, and there’s a game being played.

As mentioned before, the game is no more than two hours long thanks to the clock; our game ended 12 minutes early thanks to several quick walk-offs by the Bananas (Mark Buehrle would be proud). I’d describe the game experience as “What would happen if you let baseball players be silly on the field…and also if they were all sleeper agents (several moments in the game felt like the players all heard a trigger to do something)”. Part of the game involves the players making “trick plays” such as doing a backflip while catching the ball or throwing/catching it behind their back. Honestly…this part is actually good IMO; it showcases the physical abilities of the players as well as their body coordination.

I must say, though, that the thing I found most interesting about the game was its speed: less so the two hour aspect (though that does help), but more the fact that every inning can end in a walk-off. It adds a lot of excitement to each inning and, alongside the points system, helps keep the game close (and the fans engaged). Sure, it creates the somewhat weird situation of the sudden rule change in the ninth/final inning, but that’s just a small concession to pay for having higher levels of engagement. The Golden Batter and designated runner also feed into this, as it adds a strategic element of trying to ensure that runs are scored (MLB actually considered implementing their own version of the Golden Batter, but fans vehemently rejected the idea).

I didn’t get to see it live, but the ball four sprint is another interesting rule. For the batter, it can become a press your luck gamble if you think you can get past first; for the fielding team, it adds an element of strategy/positioning once the batter gets to ball three (which is much more intense if there are runners on base and/or two outs).

The Bananas also try to make each stop unique by having a few special guests play for them (something I believe the Harlem Globetrotters also do from time to time). For our game, the guest Bananas were:

- Doug Flutie: a former American football quarterback best known for his Hail Mary pass in 1984 (which lends its name to a street in his hometown of Natick, MA). He was supposed to only throw the first pitch, but he insisted on staying in for a whole batter - and got the out!
- Bill “Spaceman” Lee: A Red Sox pitcher from the 70s who’s also been a frequent “guest Banana”. He once had a health scare DURING a Banana Ball game, but thankfully, he’s still here!
- Jackie Bradley Jr.: A former Red Sox outfielder who, in all honestly, wasn’t actually that good…he also served as the Bananas’ Golden Batter™.
- Johnny Damon: Boston’s greatest enigma as he helped break the Curse in 2004…but also won a World Series with the Yankees five years later…plus from what I’ve heard, he’s more politically aligned with Curt Schilling than most Red Sox fans (though at least Damon didn’t leak that a teammate was dying from cancer).

There were different guests for the other game played the day before ours: Brock Holt (the first MLB player to hit for the cycle in the postseason), Keith Foulke (who was pitching when the Red Sox recorded the final out of the 2004 World Series), Matt Barnes (can’t tell you much about him except he pitched for the Sox at one point), and the All-American Rejects (yes, the band - they did a few songs on the field).

In case you were wondering, the Bananas won. On some level, that’s not really that important as the main driver here was the entertainment, but given that there is a league on the horizon as well as a playoff/championship series later this year…

### PART 8: That sweet sweet merch

Everyone knows that merchandising is one of the most important aspects for any sports team (especially one where tickets are at a premium), and the Bananas are no exception to that rule[^8].

One of the things that the Bananas have been known for over the years is having FREE SHIPPING on online merchandise purchases (if you’re in the U.S.), and when you get your stuff, it usually comes in a bright yellow box and with other free goodies (I’ve gotten stickers and drink koozies in the past). However, I’ll briefly mention the Red Sox, as they are the main tenant at Fenway Park.

The main Red Sox Team Store is not inside Fenway Park itself, but rather across the street. There are a ton of interesting things here, but if you’re looking for a hat or non-authentic jersey…I honestly don’t recommend buying them here as they’re pretty overpriced (case in point: an on-field hat here will set you back $55…and it’s not even made in the US as New Era ceased American production a while ago). There are other stands/stores both inside and outside of Fenway, though the main store still has the widest selection (and the prices aren’t better). Notably, the main store is not accessible without a ticket during events, as the section of street it’s on is closed to the public; there is a smaller store outside of the ticketed area that’s only open during games and not within the ticketed area, but I don’t know if it was open as I forgot to check (I’ve only been inside it once, and most times I’m in the area it’s closed).

If you’ve been going through these stadium reports, you probably know by now that I am a baseball merchandise collector (mainly hats/caps and jerseys when “conditions permit”, but I’ve also been getting baseballs with team logos on them). As a baseball merch collector, I already had a few Bananas jerseys and hats from their time in the Coastal Plain League (read: they look pretty much like the current uniforms but with an additional CPL logo), so I didn’t really think I’d need anything from them (the hat and jersey I wore to the game both come from their CPL era). However, I was interested in FirefIghters hats (and MAYBE jerseys, but they’re sublimated, which I don’t like), but wasn’t sure if I wanted to lug them around Fenway (and then later the rest of Boston) for a whole day (which I ended up doing anyway - you’ll see why). Thankfully, the “main” merch stand had “early access” hours in the days before the game, and since I had time due to a bunch of schedule rearrangements, I decided to check it out the day before my game.

I ended up getting:

- Logo balls for both the Bananas and Firefighters (not available online); they also had their game ball at a bunch of the stands but I already have two I ordered online
- A special “Fourth of July” t-shirt (limited time item, though it was available online)
- A large novelty ball (which is surprisingly dangerous as it’s the size of a dodgeball and not soft, and also not available online)
- A Firefighters hat
- Fans First: a book written by Banana Ball creator Jesse Cole

However, the most expensive “item” I ended up getting was…30 minutes of parking: I should have believed the garage when I saw them post their event rate outside…even if there was a Target entrance inside the garage (I guess it’s to “balance out” getting nine and a half hours of $7 validated parking on game day).

That night, I found out that the Bananas had a special Fourth of July hat with a special “SB” logo that’s rarely seen anywhere. Since I had also decided to get a “Banana Ball World Tour” shirt, I decided to revisit the merch tents when I arrived for the game (I should also note that I didn’t recall seeing the Fourth of July hat the first time). The first thing I learned upon arrival, however, was that the merch tents were PACKED.

Well…the Bananas tents were packed (but the lines moved fast). The main Firefighters tent was rather empty, and they had a special Fourth of July hat too (which I DEFINITELY didn’t recall seeing the first time). I got both hats and the World Tour shirt, then found out something rather unfortunate: merch stands for the Sox and both Banana Ball teams were open inside the K Club area pregame as well, and the lines were MUCH SHORTER - something I wished I knew beforehand (though strangely, the venue specific info page actually implied merchandise would NOT be available here). Against my better judgment, I ended up getting another Bananas hat I didn’t yet have inside the park (a hat with a green brim, which is my only “Sunday” item that’s available online).

I also checked out some of the merch areas in the middle of the game, and there were NO LINES to be found (as everyone was busy watching the game and/or trying to get concessions). I ended up getting my final items: both teams’ mini bats, as they weren’t online when I checked. I don’t recall seeing any hoodies for sale, but it was 90 degrees that day, so…

I am NOT adding up how much I spent over the two days, but it’s not a small number (especially if you throw in the parking)…

(Fun fact: I’ve occasionally seen Savannah Bananas jerseys being sold at various Dick’s Sporting Goods locations, including the one nearest Fenway Park having A TON on the day of the game. I saw the price for a youth jersey, however, and it was WAY overpriced…especially once you throw in the free shipping…)

### CONCLUSION: My personal thoughts on Banana Ball
Overall, I did enjoy the Banana Ball experience. However, I must say that the best way to describe the experience has to be…paradoxical.

On the one hand, it REALLY feels like the entertainment distracts from the sport being played. Outside of the foul ball thing, it really felt like the crowd wasn’t paying too much attention to the game outside of the times the players did things to get their attention (as well as the Red Sox guests - whose presence didn’t engage the entire audience as a lot of folks in the crowd don’t know them). Part of that was the fact that music was blaring the entire time - something you usually don’t see in pro sports (unless you’ve been to an NLL game).

It’s honestly kind of a shame, as I feel like there is actually an incredibly unique sport underneath all the antics. One of the biggest issues with baseball (at least for me) is the lack of definitive timing. This year alone, I went to a few games where nine innings were played in just over two hours (Brooklyn and Reading), and I’ve been to a game where it took almost three hours to play seven innings (Jersey Shore). Because of this, I think that baseball is the sport that fans feel LEAST guilty about leaving early, as they have no clue when the game is actually going to end (personally, it’s the ONLY sport that I ever leave early); having rules that emphasize speed of play help make going to a baseball game much more digestible (i.e. more “bang for your buck”). I also feel that there’s room to improve some of the rules, but I’m not so sure how to go about that as it involves some of MLB’s most infamous recent additions (such as the “ghost runner” for whichever team is trailing in the ninth or using the pitch clock so teams don’t just “time out” the game).

On the other hand, there are glaring issues with the presentation. The most common criticism I have heard is that the Banana Ball experience is, by and large, not well suited to larger stadiums with upper decks/outfield seats (keyword here being “heard”). The issue with sitting in these areas is that you’re removed from a lot of the more interactive parts of the game, as they all occur around the lower areas of the infield. Plus, when you can’t clearly see what’s happening on the field, you’re left having paid good money to just stare at the Jumbotron and watch what's essentially a TV broadcast. If you’re not there for the actual game of “baseball” (which, seemingly, a lot of the fans AREN’T), it’s very difficult to enjoy having a heavily muted experience.

Unfortunately, the demand means that if the Bananas can get a big stadium, it’s the right thing to do so that as many people can attend as possible (heck, they’ve managed to sell out FOOTBALL stadiums). This is why getting into the K Club is becoming increasingly important (and harder): most of the “good seats” don’t get past the K Club (remembering that VIB tickets didn’t even get to some members of the K Club), so if you want a good experience, it’s the only way to get it. The team does try to do certain things from these sections (like a “banana toss” event where players have to toss bananas from the upper deck to someone on the field), so it seems like they’re trying to address this issue.

Word on the street is that the upcoming league is going to focus on minor league stadiums, so that may also help - especially if it can get more fans into games. However, non-Bananas games are going to need to be watched CLOSELY to ensure that the league/sport isn’t being cannibalized by the runaway popularity of the Bananas (who have far more Instagram followers than the other three teams COMBINED). They’re likely stuck with the bigger venues due to this, so if demand for them is heavily outpacing demand for the sport as a whole, then that’s likely to be a problem.

In addition, some of the characters are VASTLY underutilized (looking at you Princess Potassia). I will note that there was a post game event that featured only the characters, but most fans were headed home by then (probably because it was specified that the players were NOT going to be present). I think they’d benefit from more time in the (literal) sun (and maybe the addition of a villain/heel that’s not just the Party Animals), but that may have to be a spin-off, and who knows how that would go…

One thing to keep in mind with all of this, however, is the mantra that drives everything the Bananas do:

Fans First.

Baseball is a sport that, like it or not, is becoming more driven by money and control. A lot of fans can’t go to MLB games anymore because the price for tickets is far too high to justify and/or the commitments aren’t worth it anymore (especially with teams raising prices every year and ticket scalpers prowling about). The minor leagues were changed drastically in 2020 in what was largely viewed as the beginnings of a hostile takeover by MLB (after all, many markets were left without affiliated teams, and the ones that stayed now have to upgrade their facilities or lose affiliation). There’s also an organization that has been buying up minor league teams left and right; as of this writing, they own at least one affiliate of 23 of MLB”s 30 teams. While their eventual goal for their operations is unknown, fears about their true intentions abound.

College baseball is not immune to the effects of this either, and that’s not just because NIL is changing the landscape. Coaches and players are dancing around injury concerns, and this combined with a power struggle between the summer leagues (where making money is near impossible) and the powers that be has affected that landscape significantly (case in point: the Cape Cod Baseball League shortened its schedule recently from 44 to 40 games and feels constantly in need of new host families for its players).

All of these issues, of course, are minor to the root issue facing baseball: its flagging popularity. Despite steps to improve the pace of play, it is still viewed as a slow game that, outside of small moments of excitement, is largely boring. The ends of many games are often marked by empty seats as fans have already left due to it being 10:00 PM on a worknight (this is why I think the two hour clock is important). By trying to make the fan experience as amazing as possible within a reasonable time frame, the Bananas are hoping to make people realize that baseball can be an interesting and fun sport. Is Banana Ball perfect? No - just look at how ticket selling has been going (i.e. WAY TOO well). However, the Bananas are committed to getting fans in at the price they think is right, trying to avoid having scalpers ruin the market, and make sure that their dedicated fans can get to games (or “shows” as the team refers to them) and have a good time.

It’s crazy to think that the Savannah Bananas have grown so much in just three years of Banana Ball-ing, let alone the decade they’ve been around. The fact that the Bananas have kinda sorta accidentally created an indy league is honestly kinda amazing, and I’m interested to see how things play out down the line - especially as they try to continue balancing entertainment with an honest-to-God, neat-as-blank sport.

Also, shout out to the two other people I saw while I was leaving the game wearing the CPL-era “Tequila Sunrise” jersey with the Georgia outline on the back - I thought I was the only one for the longest time! I didn’t see any other CPL-era hats however…

P.S.: Apparently another CPL team has seen the Bananas success and tried branching out as well, as the Tri-City Chili Peppers (located just south of Richmond, VA) recently introduced something called “Cosmic Baseball”. While the game is more or less just traditional baseball, what’s unique is that it’s played under black lights once it gets dark out. I almost tried to watch this in Allentown, PA, but getting in involves…a lottery. That I never entered.

### EPILOGUE: Merch Madness

A few weeks after seeing the team at Fenway, the Bananas were a bit closer to my home in New Jersey - this time at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. However, they had a different opponent for this team - the Texas Tailgaters (the team added in 2024), who had limited merch online (and no hats available that weren’t novelty cowboy hats).

I decided to check out what they had for the Tailgaters once I saw that, once again, there was an early merchandise sale. Originally, I wanted to go on Friday so I could combine this with a visit to the Wilmington Blue Rocks stadium/team store 30 minutes away in Wilmington, DE (and thus not have to think about going to a game there), but I wasn’t able to leave on that day (and it rained HARD, so it ended up being a good decision to stay home). While the Bananas had a few “new” items I didn’t recall seeing at Fenway, I wasn’t really interested in any of it; I ended up getting a flexfit Tailgaters hat (i.e. the traditional baseball style), mini bat, and ball (breaking a personal rule to not buy baseballs for teams I don’t get to watch) - three things unavailable online (as of now; I should also note that the 4th of July hats I got in Boston were listed on the Bananas’ online store a day or so before I came here). There was also a denim-ish hat that I was thinking about, but decided against as it was a snapback (a type of hat I don’t typically wear if I have other options).

I also decided to check out the Phillies team store as well and found it…surprisingly small. Like Brooklyn, it is two levels, but both levels were much larger; however, the total floorspace felt like it didn’t compare to the main Yankee or Red Sox stores (though it did feel a bit bigger than the one Yankees store that’s open on non-game days). I forgot to check their hat prices, but authentic player jerseys were priced at $400, so I’m willing to bet that hats also cost a little more here than they do at Lids...

As the Phillies are hosting the 2026 MLB All Star Game (in conjunction with America 250 or whatever it’s called), they (already) have merch for the game on sale. I ended up getting a “replica” version of the “Official Ball” for the game; while I didn’t realize the ball was a “replica” until I got home, the “authentic” version was $40, which I felt was far too steep. I also got a Phillie Phanatic plush with a Citizens Bank Park logo on its foot having previously debated whether or not to get Phanatic plushies at three different stadiums (i.e. their three affiliates I visited: Jersey Shore, Lehigh Valley, and Reading).

There was SUPPOSED to be a parking lot available for free next to the stadium, but it was closed off the entire time I was there, so I ended up parking in a nearby residential neighborhood as there was nothing saying I couldn’t park there (I did have some reservations, but then I saw someone using deck chairs as spot savers, which made me think it was fair game). Also, in order to enter the Phillies store, I had to walk OUT the security gates and then back IN via the same gates as they forgot to set up a checkpoint where I had entered.

Two months after that, the Bananas and Firefighters went to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. Once again, there was an opportunity for early merchandise, and I wanted to see if they had this one Firefighters hat I saw online. {result}
