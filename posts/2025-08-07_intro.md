Welcome!

This is a place where I intend to upload my thoughts on the sports travels I make. It's something I've been doing for a while, but have only recently decided to make its own blog/site.

However, a lot of the trip reports I currently have are from before I set this up. Therefore, I'm going to do one a day until I've caught up, so to speak.

I also have some "archives" of content from previous years, so I'll probably put those in as I see fit.

(Finally, you'll have to excuse - I copied this from my own personal blog which kinda looks like a newspaper, and I'm working on getting a new layout for this page.)
